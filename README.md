# Daily Coding Challenges
### Check my Codewars profile [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/jesseCaramalis)

To keep my skills sharp, I make it a habit to complete and push at least one coding challenge a day.


## Optimizations
I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. I also enjoy going back to old challenges with more experience, and seeing how I solved them compared to how I would now.

## Lessons Learned:

Working through hundreds of questions has taught me to approach problems from a variety of angles. 
Even if a question has me stumped, I'll always spend at least 30 minutes trying to work out as much as I can.
Anything I can't work through goes in my Anki, and then I reapproach the problem in a few weeks. Consistency is key.
